# My-Random-Hex-Color-Generator-Project
This is the first JavaScript addition to GitHub! It is a Random Hex Color Generator project I created as more web design practice. 
Have I mentioned how much I like color theory?

As a person who loves web design, I must appreciate functional languages like JavaScript as well. 
This project auto-generates random hex colors (name and hue) with the click of the button on the bottom.
If you click on the color square, you will copy the hex value to your notes (or wherever your device calls it).
Pretty handy if you work with colors all the time (totally not me...).

I took inspiration from CodingNepal for this project: https://www.codingnepalweb.com/color-palette-generator-html-css-javascript/
Initially, I didn't think my JS skills needed brushing up, but boy was I wrong!
I learned a lot during this development, but mostly, I learned to not be so hard on
myself and to be patient. Also, using correct function syntax is important.

This code will run on nearly any application. Just save it and use any web browser.
I have not purchased the web domain, it will stay code.

If you have any questions or issues with running the code, please let me know! Thank you for reading!
